# Kadeish

Welcome to our secular seder! Tonight we gather to celebrate freedom, justice, and the human spirit's enduring quest for liberation.

We raise our cups to honor all those throughout history who have struggled against oppression and tyranny. From the ancient Israelites to modern movements for civil rights, workers' rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights and more - we are inspired by the perseverance of people demanding dignity.

Just as the Israelites found the strength to cast off the chains of slavery in Egypt, may we find the courage to break free from the bonds of injustice that still persist today. This cup of wine symbolizes the joy of freedom and our commitment to creating a more just world.

Please join in raising your cups as we recite a traditional and then a secular blessing:

1. Baruch ata Adonai, Eloheinu melech ha-olam, borei pâ€™ri hagafen.

Blessed is the fruit of the vine, and the human hands that tended the vineyards to produce this wine. May it inspire us to nurture freedom, equality and compassion in our lives and our world.
