# Kadeish

We gather tonight to celebrate freedom - the freedom to think, to question, and to live according to our own reason and conscience.

We raise our cups to honor all those throughout history who have struggled against oppression and tyranny. From the ancient Israelites to modern movements for civil rights, workers' rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights and more - we are inspired by the perseverance of people demanding dignity.

Just as our forbearers went forth from Egypt, an enslaved people seeking liberty, we too affirm our commitment to justice and human dignity for all. We drink this first cup of wine as a toast to the joy of freedom and our commitment to creating a more just world.

Please join in raising your cups as we recite a traditional and then a secular blessing:

1. Baruch ata Adonai, Eloheinu melech ha-olam, borei pâ€™ri hagafen.

Blessed is the fruit of the vine, and the human hands that tended the vineyards to produce this wine. May it inspire us to nurture freedom, equality and compassion in our lives and our world.

(Drink the first cup of wine.)
