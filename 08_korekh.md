# Korekh

We now take the bitter herbs and place them between two pieces of matzah, forming a sandwich. This commemorates the simple food of our ancestors - bread and bitter herbs, representing the harsh labor they endured as slaves.

As we construct this "sandwich" tonight by placing the maror between two small pieces of matzah, we recreate an ancient tradition from the times of Hillel over 2,000 years ago. In consuming these humble foods together, we honor our ancestors' perseverance in the face of adversity.

May this simple sandwich of bread and herbs instill in us a renewed commitment to fight against oppression in all its forms. May the bread, the humble bread of affliction, represent sustenance and hope for a world where all can live in freedom and peace. As we eat it, we rededicate ourselves to the never-ending work of pursuing justice, equality and compassion for our fellow human beings.
