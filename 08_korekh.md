# Korekh

In the days before our ancestors left the bondage of Egypt, they were forced laborers with little freedom or dignity. The simple meal of bitter herbs between humble matzah reminds us of the bitterness of oppression and poverty they endured.

As we construct this "sandwich" tonight by placing the maror between two small pieces of matzah, we recreate an ancient tradition from the times of Hillel over 2,000 years ago. In consuming these humble foods together, we honor our ancestors' perseverance in the face of adversity.

May this symbolic meal inspire us to fight against injustice, poverty and oppression in all its forms today. Though the struggles have changed, the need for human dignity, freedom and compassion remains constant through the ages. Let us savor this simple food as a reminder to never become complacent in the ongoing work to create a more just and equitable world.
