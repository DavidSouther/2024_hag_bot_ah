# Karpas

We now partake of the karpas, a green vegetable representing the arrival of spring after a long winter. Just as the earth renews itself this time of year with sprouting plants and blooming flowers, we too can find renewal in our lives.

Spring is a season of rebirth, growth, and wonderful awakenings in nature. Let us be inspired by the resiliency of the natural world which returns year after year from dormancy to vibrancy. We dip the karpas in salt water, a reminder of the tears shed throughout human struggles, but also of the sustaining waters that allow for new life to emerge.

As we taste the brine on our lips, we are reminded of the countless struggles against tyranny in all lands and in all ages. We honor those who stood up for liberty, equality, and human rights in the face of overwhelming adversity.

May this vegetable, representing the green shoots of spring and rebirth, inspire us to cultivate justice, compassion and freedom wherever they are threatened. With this dipping we pledge to create a more just, verdant world for all people.
