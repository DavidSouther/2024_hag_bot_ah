# Karpas

Tonight we dip this parsley sprig into salt water, not as a symbol of tears shed by our enslaved ancestors, but as a representation of the tears shed by all who have suffered oppression and injustice throughout human history.

The salt water stings our eyes, just as oppression and subjugation have stung the eyes and hearts of the downtrodden. But this simple act of dipping renews our commitment to fighting against such cruelties.

As we taste the brine on our lips, we are reminded of the countless struggles against tyranny in all lands and in all ages. We honor those who stood up for liberty, equality, and human rights in the face of overwhelming adversity.

May this vegetable, representing the green shoots of spring and rebirth, inspire us to cultivate justice, compassion and freedom wherever they are threatened. With this dipping we pledge to create a more just, verdant world for all people.
