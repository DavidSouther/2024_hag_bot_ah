# Nirtzah

We have retold the story of the Exodus once again this year. We have recounted how our ancestors went from being an enslaved and oppressed people to achieving their freedom. This tradition inspires us to continually fight for liberation - for ourselves, for our communities, and for all who are subjected to injustice and tyranny in this world.

In our secular celebration, we recognize that the fight for liberty is an ongoing one. There are still people around the world who suffer under the yoke of tyranny, discrimination, and injustice. We recommit ourselves this night to upholding the values of freedom, equality, and human dignity for all people.

Just as ancient Israelites had to persevere through hardship to reach the Promised Land, we too must persist in working towards a world of justice and compassion. The road will not be easy, but our determination and hope give us strength.

Let us conclude this Seder by raising our final cup of wine in honor of liberty. To freedom - for ourselves, for all people, and for generations to come!
