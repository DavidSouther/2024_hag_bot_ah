# Maror

Tonight we taste the bitterness of oppression that our ancestors experienced as slaves in Egypt. But the maror also represents the many struggles for freedom that continue today around the world.

When we eat this maror, let it be a reminder of the hardships others face. The Mexican migrant worker denied basic rights. The Black family in public housing without clean water. The LGBTQ teenager afraid to walk the streets.

Racism, sexism, homophobia, poverty - all are forms of modern slavery that we must resist with conviction. Just as our ancestors liberated themselves, we too can overcome injustice through unity and righteous action.

Let this bitter taste awaken our hearts to those whose oppression is too often ignored. Though their struggles may be invisible to some, we see their pain. We taste their bitterness. And we re-commit ourselves to fighting for a just world free from bondage.

But the bitterness also calls us to find the courage within ourselves, as our ancestors did, to persevere in working towards liberty, equality and justice. May we be inspired to act to break the cycles of oppression and injustice. With firm resolve, may we help make the world a bit less bitter and harsh for all people.

So we eat the maror. We let its sharp flavor linger as motivation. For although its taste is harsh, we know that freedom is sweet indeed.
