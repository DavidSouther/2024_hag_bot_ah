# Maror

We now come to the maror, the bitter herbs. We eat these harsh, bitter greens to remind ourselves of the bitterness of oppression and injustice endured by our ancestors and by so many people throughout history and even today.

The slave laborers in Egypt ate bitter herbs, just as the impoverished and downtrodden today have little choice but to consume meager, bitter sustenance. But this bitterness also represents the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. From the bitterness of bondage came the strength and determination to persevere and overcome.

As we taste the sharp tang of these bitter herbs, we are reminded that injustice and oppression still exist in the world around us. We taste the lingering bitterness in the struggle for freedom, human rights, and dignity for all people. We cannot turn a blind eye to the bitter realities of poverty, persecution, discrimination and violence that so many endure.

But the bitterness also calls us to find the courage within ourselves, as our ancestors did, to persevere in working towards liberty, equality and justice. May we be inspired to act to break the cycles of oppression and injustice. With firm resolve, may we help make the world a bit less bitter and harsh for all people.
