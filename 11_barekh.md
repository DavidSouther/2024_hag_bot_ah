# Barekh

We have eaten our fill and satisfied our hunger on this night of freedom. As our ancestors were liberated from bondage in Egypt, we too are freed from the chains of oppression and injustice that still bind too many people in the world today.

Just as a seed contains within it the potential to sprout and blossom into a vibrant plant, each of us contains the capacity to make the world more whole, more free, more just. On this night, we rededicate ourselves to nurturing that potential within, growing into our best selves to help cultivate liberation for all.

We raise our cups in gratitude for the harvest of the earth that has nourished us, and for the struggles and sacrifices of those who came before us in pursuit of human dignity. As we drink this cup, may it strengthen our resolve to join hands across all boundaries in beloved community, working together to realize the promise of freedom.
