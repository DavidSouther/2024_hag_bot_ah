# Barekh

We have eaten our fill and satisfied our hunger on this night of freedom. As our ancestors were liberated from bondage in Egypt, we too are freed from the chains of oppression and injustice that still bind too many people in the world today.

We are thankful for the ethical consumption and production of our food, without exploitation of humans, animals, or the environment. We hope for a world where all people have access to nutritious food and basic needs are met.

We raise our cups in gratitude for the harvest of the earth that has nourished us, and for the struggles and sacrifices of those who came before us in pursuit of human dignity. As we drink this cup, may it strengthen our resolve to join hands across all boundaries in beloved community, working together to realize the promise of freedom.
