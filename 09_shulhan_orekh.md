# Shulhan Orekh

Tonight we gather together to celebrate our freedom and renew our commitment to justice and liberty for all people. As we partake in this festive meal, let us reflect on those who came before us and fought for the rights we enjoy today.

Our ancestors were once slaves in Egypt, subjected to harsh labor and oppression under the brutal regime of Pharaoh. Through their courage, resilience and righteous defiance, they broke free from the shackles of bondage and embarked on a perilous journey towards freedom.

The story of the Exodus teaches us that liberation is not easily won - it requires great sacrifice, determination and unity of purpose. Even after escaping Egypt, our ancestors faced immense hardships in the wilderness. But they persevered, fueled by the promise of a better life in a land of their own.

As we savor this meal, let us be thankful for the struggles endured so we could live as free people. And let us rededicate ourselves to the never-ending fight against tyranny, bigotry and injustice in all its forms. For the journey to true freedom is long, and the work is never complete.

In that spirit, we open our doors to the strangers, the persecuted, the refugees seeking safe haven - honoring the ancient command to "love the stranger, for you were once strangers in the land of Egypt." May this Passover renew our commitment to build a world of liberty, equality and justice for all.
