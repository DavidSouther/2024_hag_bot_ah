# Shulhan Orekh

As we savor this meal, let us be thankful for the struggles endured so we could live as free people. And let us rededicate ourselves to the never-ending fight against tyranny, bigotry and injustice in all its forms. For the journey to true freedom is long, and the work is never complete.

(Eat dinner.)
