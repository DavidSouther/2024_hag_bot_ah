# Magid

Long ago, our ancestors lived as slaves in the ancient land of Egypt. They suffered under the harsh rule of the Pharaohs, forced into grueling labor and treated as less than human.

But our ancestors were resilient. They yearned to be free from the shackles of oppression. Quietly, secretly, they kept hope alive that one day they could overthrow their oppressors and live as free people. They kept alive the dream of liberty in their hearts through the darkest days.

When the time was right, our ancestors took bold action and escaped from Egypt in a daring exodus across the wilderness. Though Pharaoh's armies gave chase, they could not stop our people's relentless march toward freedom.

Finally, our ancestors reached the safety of the Promised Land, where they could build new lives as a freed people. Through courage, perseverance and an unshakeable belief in human dignity, they had transformed themselves from slaves into a free people. The road was fraught with challenges, but their strength, resourcefulness and commitment to justice ultimately allowed them to overcome the despotic rule of Pharaoh.

On this night, we celebrate that triumphant journey from oppression to liberty. We honor the eternal human yearning to live in freedom that motivated our ancestors. And we recommit ourselves to upholding the values of justice, equality and human rights so that all people may one day know the blessing of freedom.
