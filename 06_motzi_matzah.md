# Motzi Matzah

In remembrance of our ancestors who fled Egypt with just the simple bread of freedom, we now bless and eat the matzah.

Though we no longer need to literally flee oppression, this humble food reminds us of the human drive for liberty from all that diminishes life's possibilities. As we eat the matzah, we rededicate ourselves to pursuing justice, equality and freedom in our present world.

(Recite the blessings in English or Hebrew as tradition allows):

1. Blessed is the source of life, which brings forth bread from the earth.
2. Blessed is the journey towards freedom, obligating us to consume this bread of poverty and perseverance.

Or

1. Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, haMotzi lechem min haaretz.
2. Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav, v'tzivanu al achilat matzah.

And this year, we recognize especially the tension of celebrating our modern freedoms and the freedom of the Israeli state while denouncing the unjust actions of extremists both within and without.
