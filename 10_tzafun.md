# Tzafun

We now eat the afikoman, the piece of matzah that was hidden earlier during the seder. By finding and consuming this final piece of matzah, we bring the primary ritual of the seder meal to a close.

The afikoman represents the mystery and uncertainty that has followed our ancestors through the ages. Just as this piece of matzah was once hidden from view, so too were the true histories and struggles of our forebears often obscured by repression, persecution, and mythmaking.

In eating the afikoman tonight, we honor the journeys of those who came before us - the journeys that were so often forced upon them rather than chosen freely. We acknowledge the difficulties they endured and the sacrifices they made so that we could be here today.

At the same time, the afikoman is a reminder that there is still much about our collective past that remains cloaked or has been lost to history. The gaps in our understanding should humble us and spur us to keep investigating, questioning, and learning.

Only by probing the truths that have been hidden can we fully appreciate the lives and legacies of our ancestors. So let us eat the afikoman, and commit ourselves anew to unearthing the forgotten stories that make us who we are.
