# Yahatz

In this moment, we break the middle matzah into two pieces. One half is set aside as the afikoman, to be eaten later as a culmination of the seder. The other half remains on the table with the other two whole matzot.

By breaking this matzah, we pause to reflect on the brokenness in our world and in our lives. Too many still suffer from oppression, poverty, hunger, and injustice. Our world is broken, but it need not remain that way forever.

We hide the afikoman to be discovered again at the end of the seder. This reminds us that our ancestors' perseverance allowed them to emerge from the narrows of bondage. Their courage brought them out of spiritual confinement into the open expanse of selfhood and dignity as a free people.

In breaking this matzah, we connect spiritually with our ancestral longing for freedom. May this ritual inspire us to nurture that dissenting spark in our own lives. Wherever oppression and injustice exist, may we find the fortitude to resist and persist in our pursuit of human liberation.
