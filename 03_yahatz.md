# Yahatz

In this moment, we break the middle matzah into two pieces. One half is set aside as the afikoman, to be eaten later as a culmination of the seder. The other half remains on the table with the other two whole matzot.

By breaking this matzah, we pause to reflect on the brokenness in our world and in our lives. Too many still suffer from oppression, poverty, hunger, and injustice. Our world is broken, but it need not remain that way forever.

Just as we break this matzah, we commit ourselves to working to repair the fractures in our society and our world. We will use our freedoms to fight for the freedoms of others. We will share our bread with those who have none. We will break down the barriers that divide us.

The broken matzah reminds us that there is work still to be done to create a whole, just world for all people. On this night of remembering the journey from oppression to liberation, we rededicate ourselves to that sacred work of tikkun olam - repairing the world.
