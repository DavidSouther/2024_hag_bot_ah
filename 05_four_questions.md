# Ma Nishtana

Why is this night different from all other nights?

1. That on all other nights we eat both chametz and matzah, on this night, we eat only matzah?

We eat only matzah on this night to commemorate the haste with which our ancestors fled Egypt. They had no time to let their bread rise, so they took only unleavened dough which baked into matzah in the desert sun.

2. That on all other nights we eat many vegetables, on this night, maror?

We eat the bitter herbs on this night as a reminder of the bitterness of slavery our ancestors endured in Egypt. The maror represents the harsh labor and suffering they experienced under Pharaoh's rule. We acknowledge their suffering, but also celebrate their resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity.

3. That on all other nights we do not dip vegetables even once, on this night, we dip twice?

We dip twice on this night - first into salt water representing the tears shed under oppression, and then into charoset, a sweet paste of fruits and nuts, recalling the mortar used for the bricks of slavery, but also hinting at the sweetness of eventual freedom.

4. That on all other nights some eat and drink sitting with others reclining, but on this night, we are all reclining?

We recline at the seder table as a symbol of freedom, reenacting how free people relaxed at ancient times while eating. Our ancestors in Egypt did not experience such luxuries under the harsh taskmasters. We should appreciate the liberties we have, while also recognizing the ongoing struggle for equality and human rights around the world.
