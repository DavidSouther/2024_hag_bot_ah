# Ma Nishtana

1. Why is this night different from all other nights? On all other nights we eat leavened bread and matzah, but on this night, only matzah.

Our interpretation: This question reminds us to be mindful and present in the moment. While routine can be comforting, we should also embrace opportunities to break from the ordinary and experience something new and meaningful.

2. Why is this night different from all other nights? On all other nights we eat many vegetables, but on this night, bitter herbs.  

Our interpretation: The bitter herbs represent the bitterness and hardship our ancestors endured. We acknowledge their suffering, but also celebrate their resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity.

3. Why is this night different from all other nights? On all other nights we do not dip even once, but on this night we dip twice.

Our interpretation: The double dipping reminds us to look at things from multiple perspectives. There are often layers to any situation, and we should strive to understand the nuances and complexities.

4. Why is this night different from all other nights? On all other nights we eat either sitting or reclining, but on this night we recline.

Our interpretation: Reclining represents freedom and dignity. We should appreciate the liberties we have, while also recognizing the ongoing struggle for equality and human rights around the world.

Overall, the four questions encourage us to be present, resilient, open-minded, and conscious of the human condition - values that resonate with our progressive secular Jewish identity in Brooklyn.
